# Estimating economic indicators with daytime satellite imagery

This repository is intended to be a complement to the Master's thesis project: "Prosperity at first sight? Estimating material well-being and development from daytime satellite imagery" developed in the context of Tilburg University's Master's program in Data Science and Society.

### Structure of the repository

The repository contains three directories: "data", "notebooks" and "satellite_imagery_econ_indicators". The "data" directory contains the data used in the project, however, the satellite imagery data is not included in compliance with the source's terms of use. The notebooks directory contains the relevant Python notebooks (.ipynb) developed during the project. This includes three notebooks devoted to sample building and EDA, and another four notebooks where the different models were trained and evaluated. Finally, the "satellite_imagery_econ_indicators" directory contains Python scripts (.py) that include code that is imported into the notebooks. This was done to improve the readability and overall structure of the notebooks.

### Other comments

Some parts of the repository are still under construction, some changes are expected to be made in the near future. The repository will be updated accordingly. This may include the repository's structure, the code's comments and the README file. Lastly, it is worth noting that the version of the model-related notebooks and scripts displayed may not necessarily reflect the final version of the models from which the results in the thesis were obtained although this is mostly the case.
